Some of the questions below require you to draw a heap or to trace through a heap algorithm on a specific array.  You may do so using \LaTeX packages that you can research and learn how to use.  You may also use a computer drawing program (i.e. PowerPoint or similar), create your diagrams, and export them as a PDF file (I find that it also helps to trim the PDF file using graphics software.)  Then you can import the PDF file into your solution.

\question[5]
What are the $\floor{n/2}$ minimum and maximum number of elements in a heap of height $h$?
\newline

%At most, it is a perfect binary tree, which is $2^(h+1) âˆ’ 1$; at least, there is only one at the last level, which is $2^h$.
\begin{solutionorbox}
At most, it is a perfect binary tree, which is $2^(h+1) - 1$; at least, there is ony one at the last level, which is $2^h$.

\question[5]
Is the array with values $\left<23, 17, 14, 6, 13, 10, 1, 5, 7, 12\right>$ a max-heap?  Show your work by using computer software to draw the heap.

\begin{solutionorbox}
	\newline
	In a max-heap every node should be greater than its child, node with value of 6 is less than its child which is node with a value of 7. Hence it is not a max heap.
\begin{verbatim}
def extractMax(self):  
     popped = self.Heap[self.FRONT]
     self.Heap[self.FRONT] = self.Heap[self.size]
     self.size -= 1
     self.maxHeapify(self.FRONT)          
     return popped

\question[10]
Illustrate (using computer software) the operation of $\proc{Max-Heapify}{(A,3)}$ on the array $A = \left< 27, 17, 3, 16, 13, 10, 1, 5, 7, 12, 4, 8, 9, 0\right>$.  Show how a heap element will trickle down the heap level-by-level.

\question[5]
Starting with the procedure $\proc{Max-Heapify}{(A,i)}$, write pseudocode for the procedure $\proc{Min-Heapify}{(A,i)}$, which performs the corresponding manipulation on a min-heap.  How does the running time of $\proc{Min-Heapify}$ compare to that of $\proc{Max-Heapify}$?

\begin{lstlisting}
MIN-HEAPIFY(A, i):
	l <- LEFT(i)
	r <- RIGHT(i)
	smallest <- i
	if l <= heap-size[A] and A[l] < A[i]:
		then smallest <- l
	if r <= heap-size[A] and A[r] < A[smallest]:
		then smallest <- r
	if smallest != i:
		then swap(A[i], A[smallest])
			MIN-HEAPIFY(A, smallest)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{center}
	The running time is the same. Actually, the algorithm is the same with the exceptions of two comparisons and some names.

\question[10]
Illustrate (using computer software) the operation of $\proc{Build-Max-Heap}$ on the array $A = \left< 5, 3, 17, 10, 84, 19, 6, 22, 9\right>$.  Each diagram should show the placement of an array element into its final position in the heap.

\question[5]
Why do we want the loop index $i$ in line 3 of $\proc{Build-Max-Heap}$ to decrease from $\floor{A.length/2}$ to 1 rather than increase from 1 to $\floor{A.length/2}$?

\begin{center}
	If we start from 1, because its subtree is not a maximum heap, we can't follow this order.

Illustrate (using computer software) the operation of $\proc{Heapsort}$ on the array $A = \left< 5, 13, 2, 25, 7, 17, 20, 8, 4 \right>$.  Show the original input array, the heap after $\proc{Build-Heap}$, and then after each call to $\proc{Build-Max-Heap}$.

\question[5]
What is the running time of $\proc{Heapsort}$ on an array $A$ of length $n$ that is already sorted in increasing order?  What about decreasing order?

\begin{center}	
If the array is in either ascending or descending order we have a run time of O(n lg n).
